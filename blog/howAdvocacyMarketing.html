It sounds strange and improbable, but we have to keep in mind that your client knows what he likes and what he does not like, so why not make your own client talk about you. Why not make your most unconditional fan the one who talks about the brand?</p>

Now let's bear in mind that the social media revolution makes us talk about everything at all times, and that certain types of brands, people or comments grow exponentially with the new technology, why not reward customers who do or have made your brand grow exponentially with a timely comment?

                                                <p>This is called Advocacy branding or advocacy marketing, and with the evolution (revolution) of new technologies and social networks, it is becoming a very effective (and cheap) tool to advertise your company.</p>

                                            <p>7.76% of individuals consulted say that they trust more than what another common person says about a brand, than what the brand says about itself and the average of connections in social networks of a person is 400 friends, that is Each post from a common person on Instagram, google +, bing, facebook, pinterest, etc., reaches an average of 400 people.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>With these two facts, we fear that if we get one of the brand's most loyal fans to talk about us, the message will reach 400 people for free, and that those 400 people will fully trust that message and become interested in your product. Sounds good right?</p>
                                            <p>Not only that, it is proven that for every 10 defenders of your brand, you will reach 6000 personal buyers (potential buyers). With 100 defenders, you will reach 60,000, and with 1000 you will reach 600,000.</p>

                                            <h6>- What should we do to get advocates?</h6>
                                            <p>Be consistent: the company must be consistent in all its aspects. That what the client sees and reads makes sense. Customer service must respond in a reasonable time. Products must be well related to what is being sold. An advocate of your brand does not want to suggest something to his friends that later will not work.</p>
                                            <p>Offer a unique experience: Customers do not just want the product to be practical, but to talk about it, the magnificent purchase they made, the doubt that arose and they received exceptional attention, the discount they made, etc. The experience must be from the advertisement to a possible return, service and customer service, web, advertising, etc. This also creates brand stories within your brand that increase customer satisfaction and experience.</p>
                                            <p>Customers first mindset: Give everything for the customer. The brand is important, but the customer is the one who is going to buy the brand and talk about it, so we must focus on making them feel comfortable and at ease.</p>
                                            <p> Look for those brand advocates and make it easy for them: Finding those advocates is not easy at first glance, if you go in the comments on social media, in the responses to the customer service or in the emails, you see that generally there are several people who repeat themselves and are delighted with what you do. You don't have to hire them, but maybe it is interesting to offer a discount or a code to send it to a friend and receive a discount. Enter your comments write hashtags. This will make the task easy.</p>
